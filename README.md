Reetlearn API v1 is made with Flask(Python) with JWT algorithm for access token production whereby almost all endpoints require authorization header

    - Right after the API url, /api/v1 must be appended in order to use the API e.g https://reetlearn.onrender.com/api/v1 [This will display all endpoints in Reetlearn]
